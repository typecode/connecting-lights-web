Gives your blog a set of options which are defined by the theme.

Simple Options lets your theme define a set of options. It creates a light weight options panel that looks just like WordPress itself. Nothing fancy here.

== Installation ==

Just download and install this plugin like any standard WordPress plugin. Your theme will handle the rest.
